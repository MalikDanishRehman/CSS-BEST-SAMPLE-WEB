        Resource refers to all the materials available in our environment which are technologically accessible,
        economically feasible and culturally sustainable and help us to satisfy our needs and wants. Resources can
        broadly be classified according to their availability as renewable or national and international resources. An
        item may become a resource with technology. The benefits of resource utilization may include increased wealth,
        proper functioning of a system, or enhanced well. From a human perspective, a regular resource is anything to
        satisfy human needs and wants.
